- Publish to queue:


- scenario all ok:
    - ActionInstructionConfirmCallback.confirm called with ack true - cause null


- scenario RabbitMQ down:
    - ActionInstructionConfirmCallback & ActionInstructionReturnCallback NOT called.
    - TX is working though.


- scenario only queue is deleted:
    - ActionInstructionReturnCallback.returnedMessage is called.
           - log = Delivery of message to queue failed. Cause is NO_ROUTE.
    - ActionInstructionConfirmCallback.confirm is called.
            - log = confirming message with ack true - cause null - correlationDataId 551308fb-2d5a-4477-92c3-649d915834c3,SAMPLED_INIT
            - ack = true is correct as the message reached the exchange.


- scenario exchange is deleted:
    - ActionInstructionConfirmCallback.confirm is called with ack = FALSE.


- note that calls to ActionInstructionConfirmCallback & ActionInstructionConfirmCallback are asynchronous.
